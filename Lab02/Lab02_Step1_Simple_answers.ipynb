    "## Quiz Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What are the key metrics used to evaluate the LLM in this lab, and why are they important for responsible AI?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   The key metrics used in this lab are:\n",
    "   - `LLMContextRecall`: Ensures that the model accurately recalls relevant information from the context provided.\n",
    "   - `FactualCorrectness`: Assesses whether the LLM’s outputs are factually correct, which is crucial in real-world applications where inaccurate information can have serious consequences.\n",
    "   - `Faithfulness`: Measures whether the model remains faithful to the input data without generating hallucinations or unrelated information.\n",
    "   - `SemanticSimilarity`: Evaluates the similarity between the expected and actual outputs in terms of meaning, helping ensure the model's responses are relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "   These metrics are important for responsible AI because they help ensure that the model's outputs are reliable, accurate, and aligned with real-world expectations, reducing potential risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **How does the `LangchainLLMWrapper` ensure that the evaluation process is repeatable?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   The `LangchainLLMWrapper` encapsulates the LLM in a standard interface, making it easy to switch between models and run evaluations in a consistent and repeatable manner. By using standardized wrappers, others can reproduce the evaluation process exactly, ensuring repeatability and transparency in AI experimentation.\n",

    "3. **Why is it important to assess the `FactualCorrectness` of an LLM when deploying it in real-world applications?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Assessing `FactualCorrectness` is critical because LLMs are often used in applications where accurate and reliable information is essential, such as legal, medical, or financial settings. Ensuring that the model generates factually correct responses minimizes the risk of misinformation, which is a key component of responsible AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Explain how using environment variables for the API key contributes to responsible AI practices.**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Using environment variables for the API key helps protect sensitive credentials from being exposed in the code, which aligns with responsible AI practices around data privacy and security. It ensures that the API key is handled securely, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and protecting sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What is the significance of converting the evaluation results into a DataFrame for further analysis?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Converting the evaluation results into a DataFrame allows for easier manipulation, visualization, and analysis of the data. DataFrames provide a structured and organized way to explore results, which facilitates transparent evaluation, better understanding of model performance, and the ability to share findings with others for verification or replication, which is important for responsible and repeatable AI.\n"
